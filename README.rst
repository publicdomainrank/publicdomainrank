Code for "Public Domain Rank"
=============================

This repository collects code used to process and rearrange data from Wikipedia
and the Online Books Page into a format suitable for analysis.

There is no documentation and this is unsupported research code. If there
is a Public Domain Rank 2.0, expect considerable improvement on this front.

See `README-data.md` for details about acquiring the raw data (far too large to
be included in this repository) which this code processes.
